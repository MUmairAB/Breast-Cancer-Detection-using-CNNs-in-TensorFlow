# Breast Cancer Detection using CNNs in TensorFlow

This project uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Breast Cancer detection (a classification problem). 

## Stats about breast cancer

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020 alone, there were [2.3 million](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer) reported cases of breast cancer among women, resulting in **685,000** deaths worldwide. By the end of the same year, there were approximately **7.8 million** women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past five years, establishing it as the most prevalent form of cancer globally.

Worldwide, female breast cancer is the [fifth](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/breast-cancer/statistics#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%2043%2C700,world%20died%20from%20breast%20cancer.) leading cause of death. 

## Introduction


As stated by [Pamela Wright](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/breast-cancer/invasive-ductal-carcinoma-idc), the medical director of the Breast Center at Johns Hopkins, **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** (**IDC**), also referred to as **infiltrating ductal carcinoma**, is the predominant type of breast cancer. It represents 80% of all breast cancer diagnoses. For further information about IDC, please refer to this [article](https://www.breastcancer.org/types/invasive-ductal-carcinoma). In the context of this project, we have developed a classification model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow. The model utilizes **Histopathology Images** of patients to classify whether they have breast cancer or not!

## Dataset
We are using the dataset from Kaggle. It can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images/code?datasetId=7415&sortBy=voteCount). Following are some of the properties of this dataset:

The initial dataset comprised 162 slide images of breast cancer specimens scanned at a magnification of 40x. Due to their large dimensions, 277,524 patches measuring 50Ã—50 pixels were extracted from these images to improve their manageability. These patches encompass the regions that contain Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), thereby enabling more efficient processing and analysis.

* 198,738 negative examples (i.e., no breast cancer)
* 78,786 positive examples (i.e., indicating breast cancer)

The dataset assigns a unique filename structure to each image, like:
```
u_xX_yY_classC.png 

```
For example:
```
10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png
```

- "u" is patient id
- "u" is the patient ID (10253_idx5), 
- "X" is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, 
- "Y" is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and 
- "C" indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.
